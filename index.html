    <h2>Welcome to Pueblo Lucena</h2>
<p>Whether you are staying in Pueblo Lucena for the first time or visiting again like many people do, we would like to offer you a warm welcome and a very pleasant stay.
  About the community</p>
Pueblo Lucena is a small community consisting of only 16 properties which share and enjoy the tranquil surroundings of the beautiful gardens and pool.
Mostly, properties are occupied by residents and their families though a small number also allow use of their apartments to holidaymakers.  
We would be grateful if you would take a moment to read this leaflet. It contains some important information to enable everyone to enjoy the facilities safely and peacefully.
