       About the community      </div>
    
  <div class="myDivwhite"> <div class="myDivwhite">   
    <p>Pueblo Lucena is a small community consisting of only 16 properties which share and enjoy the tranquil surroundings of the beautiful gardens and pool.</p>
<p>Mostly, properties are occupied by residents and their families though a small number of owners also allow use of their apartments to holidaymakers.</p>  
    </div></div>
     
  
  
  
    <div class="myDivwhite"> <div class="myDivdblue">
      <h3>Access</h3>
    <p>Access to the community is via the carpark or through the side gate situated in Calle Velez Malaga and only one key is required to open all communal gates.</p>
        <p> When leaving via the side gate, a gate release button can be found at the bottom of the steps.</p>
        <p> When leaving the community on foot via the car park, please use the pedestrian gate within the electronic gate.</p>
        <p> Please take care to lock both of the gates into the carpark and into the gardens when entering and leaving the community and also to
          ensure that the side gate closes  and locks behind you.  </p>
<p>In the event that the electronic gate does not work the motor can be disengaged to allow the gate to be opened manually. To do this:-</p>
    <ul><li>Take the key from the keypad on the wall adjacent to the motor</li>
      <li>Place the key in the motor and turn</li>
      <li>Push up firmly on the handle on the top of the motor</li></ul>
<p>It should now be possible to slide the gate manually. When finished please close the gate and reverse the steps above to re-engage the motor, then leave by the pedestrian gate.</p>
