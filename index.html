    <h2>About the community</h2>
    
    <p>Pueblo Lucena is a small community consisting of only 16 properties which share and enjoy the tranquil surroundings of the beautiful gardens and pool.</p>
<p>Mostly, properties are occupied by residents and their families though a small number also allow use of their apartments to holidaymakers.</p>  
<p>We would be grateful if you would take a moment to read this leaflet. It contains some important information to enable everyone to enjoy the facilities safely and peacefully.</p>

      Emergency Services
  </div>
    <div class="myDiv3">  
<p>Spain has three emergency services: the police (policía), the fire brigade (cuerpo de bomberos), and the ambulance service (ambulancía).</p>
<p>You can contact the emergency services in Spain by calling the pan-European emergency number (112) from any telephone. When you call 112, the operator diverts you to the relevant emergency service. The individual emergency services are also available at the following numbers:</p>
    <ul><li>Ambulance: 061</li>
    <li>Fire brigade: 080</li>
    <li>National police: 091</li>
      <li>Local police: 092</li></ul>
    </div>
   
    
    <div class="myDiv2">
      <h2>Information about the community</h2>
      
<p>Access to the community is via the carpark or side gate situated in Calle Velez Malaga. Only one key is required to open all communal gates. When leaving via the side gate, a gate release button can be found at the bottom of the steps. When leaving the community on foot via the car park, please use the pedestrian gate within the electronic gate. Please take care to lock both of the gates into the carpark and into the gardens when entering and leaving the community and also to ensure that the side gate closes  and locks behind you.  
In the event that the electronic gate does not work the motor can be disengaged to allow the gate to be opened manually. To do this:-</p>
    <ul><li>Take the key from the keypad on the wall adjacent to the motor</li>
      <li>Place the key in the motor and turn</li>
      <li>Push up firmly on the handle on the top of the motor</li></ul>
<p>It should now be possible to slide the gate manually. When finished please close the gate and reverse the steps above to re-engage the motor, then leave by the pedestrian gate.   
Like all communities in Spain, Pueblo Lucena has a set of rules.  A full copy of these can be found on the notice board in the passage between the 2 blocks of houses.</p>
